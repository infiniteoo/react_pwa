While the client-side application works well and looks great, this was not the main focus of this project.

For this project we were focused on creating a Progressive Web Application - or PWA - that simulates the functionality of a smartphone app.

Once set up properly, a download icon appears on the far right side of the URL bar in Chrome, which will install the app on your local machine.  This means the app will function offline (or do-so in a limited fashion if the app needs the internet to fully function), an icon will be placed on your desktop, and when opened, your PWA will open on your desktop as if it were installed software!

This is the cheapest and fastest way to turn an existing website into a sort of "poor man's" smartphone app.  At the end of the day, if your resources allow, you'll want native versions of your product built for Andriod and iOS.


## Built With:

### * React
### * Axios
